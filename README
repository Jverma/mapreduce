This repo contains Python implementation of MapReduce algorithms for a variety of common data processing tasks

The Python MapReduce framework used faithfully implements the MapReduce programming model, but it executes entirely on a single machine, it does not involve parallel computation. 

The algorithms implemented includes - Word Count, Inverted Index, Sparse matrix multiplication, Counting friends in social network among others.

All the codes take JSON input.
